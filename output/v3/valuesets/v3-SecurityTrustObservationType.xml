        <i>Usage Note: </i>SecurityTrustObservationType may be used as a trust attribute in a computable trust policy, trust credential, trust assertion, or trust label field in a security label and populated with trust observation values.  The valued trust attributes may be used for used for authentication, authorization, and access control decisions.  These may also be used to negotiate trust relationships, adjudicate or bridge trust policies, and to specify requirements for participation in a Trust Domain or for asserting compliance with a Trust Framework.
