      <p>The Consent class represents informed consents and all similar medico-legal transactions between the patient (or his legal guardian) and the provider.

      <p>The details of consents vary. Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention.

      <p>The &quot;signatures&quot; to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of &quot;performer&quot;, the healthcare provider informing the patient, and &quot;consenter&quot;, the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public.</p>
                  
      <p>Some consent has a minimum required delay between the consent and the service, so as to allow the patient to rethink his decisions.
