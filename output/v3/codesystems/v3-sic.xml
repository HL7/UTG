      <p>The Standard Industrial Classification Codes that appear in a company&#39;s disseminated EDGAR filings indicate the company&#39;s type of business. These codes are also used in the Division of Corporation Finance as a basis for assigning review responsibility for the company&#39;s filings. For example, a company whose business was Metal Mining (SIC 1000) would have its filings reviewed by staffers in A/D Office 4.
