    <code value="exam"/>
    <display value="Exam"/>
    <definition value=" Observations generated by physical exam findings including direct observations made by a clinician and use of simple instruments and the result of simple maneuvers performed directly on the patient&#39;s body."/>
  </concept>
  <concept id="23736">
    <code value="imaging"/>
    <display value="Imaging"/>
    <definition value=" Observations generated by imaging. The scope includes observations, plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, echocardiography, nuclear medicine."/>
  </concept>
  <concept id="23737">
    <code value="laboratory"/>
    <display value="Laboratory"/>
    <definition value=" The results of observations generated by laboratories. Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory."/>
  </concept>
  <concept id="23738">
    <code value="procedure"/>
    <display value="Procedure"/>
    <definition value=" Observations generated by other procedures. This category includes observations resulting from interventional and non-interventional procedures excluding lab and imaging (e.g. cardiology catheterization, endoscopy, electrodiagnostics, etc.). Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular information about component observations made during a procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy."/>
  </concept>
  <concept id="23734">
    <code value="social-history"/>
    <display value="Social History"/>
    <definition value=" The Social History Observations define the patient&#39;s occupational, personal (e.g. lifestyle), social, and environmental history and health risk factors, as well as administrative data such as marital status, race, ethnicity and religious affiliation."/>
