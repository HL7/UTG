  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    This is the home page for the full set of all terminology defined and published by HL7, as part of the new UTG process.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Unified Terminology Governance (UTG) project is centralizing HL7 vocabulary artifacts (Code Systems, Value Sets, Concept Maps, etc.) 
    across all product families (v2, v3/CDA, FHIR).  Among the outcomes of UTG are: 
    (1) improvements to internal maintenance and harmonization processes, 
    (2) a single entry point for the user community to access content for browsing and downloading, and 
    (3) guidance for implementers of HL7-curated terminologies.  
    Platform independent tooling has been developed to support consensus-based authoring and reviewing of proposed changes to 
    content among worldwide stakeholders.
