	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This is the home page for the full set of all terminology defined and published by HL7, as part of the new UTG process.  These pages contain the HL7 mintained code systems, value sets, concept domains, and V2 Tables that are maintained as part of the unified governance process for Terminology, adopted by HL7 in 2020
  </p>
	<p>
    The Unified Terminology Governance (UTG) project as defined and developed a process which is centralizing HL7 vocabulary artifacts (Code Systems, Value Sets, Concept Maps, etc.) 
    across all product families (v2, v3/CDA, FHIR).  Among the outcomes of UTG are:
  </p>
	<ol>
		<li>improvements to internal maintenance and harmonization processes,</li>
		<li>a single entry point for the user community to access content for browsing and downloading, and</li>
		<li>guidance for implementers of HL7-curated terminologies.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
    Platform independent tooling has been developed to support consensus-based authoring and reviewing of proposed changes to 
    content among worldwide stakeholders.  Note that certain identified terminology artifacts are tightly bound to model structures in HL7, and thus are not subject to a unified consensus change process; these artifacts (primarily code systems, but include some value sets and other objects as well) must be changed and approved through the regular HL7 Standards balloting process.   Copies of these may be found on these pages with the other content for the convenience of the HL7 community.
