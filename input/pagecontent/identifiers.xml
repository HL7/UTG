    Identifier Systems that are defined here are for the convenience of HL7 implementers.  These resources serve the 
    special purpose of capturing for easy access descriptive metadata information about each system of identifiers registered 
    here.  
  </p>
  <p>
    These pages contain the metadata information for systems of identifiers that are published in the HL7 Terminology pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    The systems here are typically used in data types supporting identifier systems, often called namespaces.
