    This page shows a list of Code Systems that HL7 has published at some time in the past, but have been retired and are no longer being maintained, and are deprecated for current use.  These originated  
    across primarily the Version 2 and Version 3 product lines.  These show 'Retired' as their status. These code systems 
    are shown here in order to assist the HL7 community to understand and process historic content. 
    Codes from retired code systems should not be used to create new records.
