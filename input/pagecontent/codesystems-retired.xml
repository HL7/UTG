    This page shows a list of Code Systems that HL7 has published at some time in the past, but have been either retired and are no longer being published, or deprecated for current use.  These originated  
    across primarily the Version 2 and Version 3 product lines.  Those that are deprecated show a status of Active, although they are on a schedule to be retired at some point in the future. Those that 
    are retired show 'Retired' as their status. These code systems 
    are shown here in order to assist the HL7 community to understand and perhaps process historic content, and to have a 'heads up' for those that will be retired in the future. 
    Codes from retired code systems should not be used to create new records, and those in Deprecated code systems should be used with caution.
