<h4>Version Issues</h4>
<p>
The FDA published list of NDC codes for <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm142438.htm">finished drug products</a> is updated daily.
Use the format YYYYMMDD to refer to a particular distribution. Note that while only valid NDC codes appear in the distribution file, there are other NDC codes
that organizations have assigned but not yet reported to FDA.  Therefore, the full set of NDCs that exists in the marketplace is unknown and cannot be
versioned completely.

NDC codes have no copyright acknowledgment or license requirements.
