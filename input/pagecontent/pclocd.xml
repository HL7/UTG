<h4>Copyright Issues</h4>

<p>Users may incorporate portions of pCLOCD into another document
(e.g., an implementation guide or other technical specification) for
distribution outside of the User's corporation or organization, subject to
these terms in addition to the terms and conditions specified in the LOINC and
RELMA Terms of Use.</p>

table must include the following notice:</p>
