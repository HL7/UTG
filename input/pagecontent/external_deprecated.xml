    Deprecation should not be confused with retirement. Deprecation provides usage guidance specifying that the object SHOULD not be used for new or revised content, whereas retirement indicates it SHALL NOT be used for new or revised content. Deprecation is an HL7-specific process that provides users of HL7 specifications with guidance for using objects within HL7 implementations. For example, an object may be deprecated if it has been in use for some time and then gets updated or replaced, and guidance is to be provided for what to use instead. This may also be done when planning for a Terminology to be retired in the near future.

  <p>
    Deprecation of External Content records require oversight and approval from the Terminology Services Management Group (TSMG).
