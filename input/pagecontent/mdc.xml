<h3>Summary</h3>

<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Source</td><td>
 Medical Device Communications (MDC) codes are from ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclature standard and amendments. This is a detailed system of 
 codes used in personal health devices and and acute-care (point-of-care) medical devices for identification of physiological measurements 
 and also for alerts, alarms, and numerous technical conditions such as calibration state and battery state. The physiological measurements 
 can in most common cases be mapped to LOINC if desired using a table of equivalences developed by LOINC. Medical Codes and related values 
 are available from the <a href="https://rtmms.nist.gov/rtmms/">Rosetta Terminology Mapping Management System (RTMMS)</a>, maintained by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and 
 Technology. RTMMS includes new codes in the process of being published in the standard.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions on Use of MDC Nomenclature</h3>
<p>
Source: <a href="http://www.11073.org/">11073.org Our Standards > Conditions of Use</a>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Q. If I am writing a commercial application that takes medical measurements (perhaps from a proprietary device) and transcodes it to an HL7 V2 message or V3 document or FHIR resources using IEEE 11073 nomenclature codes, ref-ids, and descriptions obtained from RTMMS or are my own, am I required to pay any type of fee to IEEE?
</blockquote>
A. No. If you wish to obtain the official 11073-10101 standard you will need to purchase that document. However, if you are just interested in using the codes, Ref-ids,  and even descriptions, they are freely available in the NIST RTMMS tool.
</p>

<blockquote>
Q. If I am writing a commercial application that decodes HL7 V2 messages, V3 documents, and FHIR resources, and displays the contents in a human readable form where the descriptions of the codes are my own or are from RTMMS, am I required to pay any type of fee to IEEE?
</blockquote>
A. No.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Q. If I make a commercial library with source where one of the source files contains all the codes, ref-id, and descriptions (either my own or from the RTMMS tool) needed for the type of application it supports, am I required to pay any type of fee to IEEE?

A. No.

<h3>Reference Identifiers</h3>
<p>
Text reference identifiers are given in the standards for each numeric code identifying a concept.
Since they were constructed in simple patterns that are usually easy for humans to deduce meanings 
from, they are convenient for human readers, where the numeric codes are not. They are generally 
composed of upper case letters such as MDC_ECG_HEART_RATE. The few exceptions are cases that where
 mixed-case identifiers are familiar to end users, such as identifiers for certain ECG leads.
</p>

<a name="partitions"> </a>
<h3>Partition Codes</h3>

<p>
The MDC codes are 32-bit, four-byte, integers. The most significant 16 bits are partition codes. 
Partitions define terminology groups, for example the dimension partition contains all the unit 
codes. There are currently the following partitions defined:
</p>

<table class="grid">
  <tr><td>Name</td><td>Reference Identifier</td><td>Code</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unspecified</td><td>MDC_PART_UNSPEC</td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Object infrastructure</td><td>MDC_PART_OBJ</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Supervisory Control And DataAcquisition (SCADA)</td><td>MDC_PART_SCADA</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Event</td><td>MDC_PART_EVT</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Dimension</td><td>MDC_PART_DIM</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Virtual Attribute</td><td>MDC_PART_VATTR</td><td>5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Parameter Group</td><td>MDC_PART_PGRP</td><td>6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Body Sites</td><td>MDC_PART_SITES</td><td>7</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Infrastructure</td><td>MDC_PART_INFRA</td><td>8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>File Exchange Format</td><td>MDC_PART_FEF</td><td>9</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ECG Extension</td><td>MDC_PART_ECG_EXTN</td><td>10</td></tr>
  <tr><td>IDCO Extension</td><td>MDC_PART_IDCO_EXTN</td><td>11</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Disease Management</td><td>MDC_PART_PHD_DM</td><td>128</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Health and Fitness</td><td>MDC_PART_PHD_HF</td><td>129</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Assisted Independent Living</td><td>MDC_PART_PHD_AI</td><td>130</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Return codes</td><td>MDC_PART_RET_CODE</td><td>255</td></tr>
  <tr><td>External Nomenclature</td><td>MDC_PART_EXT_NOM</td><td>256</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Device settings</td><td>MDC_PART_SETTINGS</td><td>258</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Private</td><td>MDC_PART_PVT</td><td>1024</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Some of the partitions are currently used only for Personal Health Devices (PHDs) 
such as the Health and Fitness partition. Others, such as the virtual attribute 
partition, are only used by Point of Care Devices (PoCDs). However, there is 
nothing in either the 11073-10201, 11073-20601, or 11073-10101 standards that 
limit the use of any partition to either PoCDs or PHDs
</p>

<a name="terms"> </a>
<h3>Term Codes</h3>

<p>
The least significant 16-bits are term codes. While there are only a few partitions, 
for many of the partitions there are thousands of term codes. The term code, along 
with the partition, identifies the item. The example below shows a heart rate 
measurement encoding from an ECG device in XML and JSON:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;coding&gt;
   &lt;system value="urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101"/&gt;
   &lt;code value="147842"/&gt;
   &lt;display value="MDC_ECG_HEART_RATE"/&gt;
 &lt;/coding&gt;
</pre> 
<pre class="json">
  coding": [{
    "system": "urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101",
    "code": "147842",
    "display": "MDC_ECG_HEART_RATE"
  }]
</pre> 
<p>
If one converts the code 147842 into HEX, the value becomes 0x24182. The 
most significant 16 bits indicates that the code comes from the SCADA 
partition (2) and the term code is 0x4182 or 16770. Implementers can 
easily obtain the partition and term codes using simple binary AND and 
SHIFT operations. If one looks up this code in the RTMMS tool one will 
find an array of information about the code, for example, 
the term description “Rate of cardiac beats”.
