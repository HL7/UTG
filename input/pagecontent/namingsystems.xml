    Naming Systems that are defined here are for the convenience of HL7 implementers.  These naming system resources serve the 
    special purpose of capturing for easy access multiple different identifiers for Code Systems that have been used in the past, as well as those that are currently preferred. 
    THey are made available here for those that are looking for identifiers that may have been published in the past in HL7 Standards, 
    but have been superceded since that time.
