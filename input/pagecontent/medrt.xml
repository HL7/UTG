<h3>Usage Notes</h3>
<p>
The MED-RT code system includes relationships between MED-RT concepts and concepts in external code systems, as well as 
relationships between concepts only in the external code systems. The external code systems that MED-RT references 
include RxNorm, MeSH, and SNOMED CT US Edition.
</p>
<p>
The representation of the contents of MED-RT in a FHIR CodeSystem resource may contain all concepts defined as existing 
solely in MED-RT, and relationships between concepts defined within MED-RT, and between MED-RT concepts and a concept 
in an external code system. In addition, ConceptMap resource(s) will be needed in order to represent the relationships 
in MED-RT that exist between external code systems.
</p>
<p>
<i>Currently all references to external code systems in MED-RT are to a specific version of the external code system.</i>

<h3>Version Issues</h3>
<p>
MED-RT is released as part of UMLS.  Therefore, each successive release has the date of the UMLS release as its version.
</p>

<h3>Copyright/License Issues</h3>

<p>
MED-RT has no copyright acknowledgement required.  However, users must adhere to the UMLS license.

<h3>Filter Properties</h3>


<p>
This section documents the property filters that can be used with the MED-RT
code system in value set composition statements (ValueSet.compose).
</p>


<h4>By Subsumption</h4>

<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Description</td><td>Select a set of concepts based on subsumption testing</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Property Name</td><td>concept</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Operations Allowed</td><td>is-a</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Values Allowed</td><td>NUI</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Comments</td><td>Includes all concepts that have a transitive is-a relationship with the concept Id provided in the value as an NUI (including the concept itself)</td></tr>
