<h4>Copyright Issues</h4>
<p>The terms of use for LOINC require that a <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/license.html#loinc">notice</a> be included with any use of LOINC codes. This notice must appear in the <i>copyright</i> element of any value set that includes LOINC codes (either in the code or filter elements, or in an expansion):</p>
<pre>
&lt;copyright value=&quot;This material contains content from LOINC (<a href="http://loinc.org">http://loinc.org</a>).

<p>Additional copyright statements may also be found in the <i>copyright</i> element. Some LOINC codes have 3rd party copyright statements. When these codes are included in a value set, they must carry their own copyright statement as well.</p>

<!-- LOINC FHIR Terminology Server -->
<a name="LOINC FHIR Terminology Server"> </a>
<h4>LOINC FHIR Terminology Server</h4>
<p>Regenstrief Institute provides access to LOINC's terminology content through the HL7® FHIR® API. See the LOINC FHIR Terminology Server <a href="https://loinc.org/fhir/">page</a> for details.</p>
<p>
Note that the FHIR server at <a href="https://fhir.loinc.org/">fhir.loinc.org</a> is a work in progress; where the service does not agree with the content on this page, implementers should consider
this as a problem with the LOINC service that is planned to be reconciled with this page.
</p>

<!-- Case Sensitivity -->
<a name="Case Sensitivity"> </a>
<h4>Case Sensitivity</h4>
<p>
LOINC codes, property names, filter names and designation types are considered case sensitive. For comparison purposes (e.g. when executing a filter), 
LOINC displays, and property values are not case sensitive, though implementers SHOULD maintain the correct case when using LOINC codes and property values.
</p>

<!-- Use of LOINC PARTS -->
<a name="Use of LOINC PARTS"> </a>
<h4>Use of LOINC PARTS</h4>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://loinc.org/kb/users-guide/additional-content-in-the-loinc-distribution/">LOINC Manual</a> section 9.3, 
LOINC Parts are a coded representation of a value for a dimension used to specify a LOINC Term which are assigned a non-semantic identifier 
with a "LP" prefix and a mod-10 check digit. Following the LOINC license, these part codes may be used in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
 <li>As a parameter to $lookup or $validate - part codes are considered valid LOINC codes in the terminology infrastructure</li>
 <li>In the response to a $lookup on a LOINC code</li>
 <li>In filter properties, as described below</li>
 <li>In <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/structuredefinition-definitions.html">Structure Definitions</a>, where the structure describes the use of a set of LOINC codes</li>
 <li>In a <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/conceptmap.html">ConceptMap</a> resource, where mappings between LOINC codes and other codes are being defined</li>
</ul>
<p>Part codes are the same LOINC system (http://loinc.org) and SHALL be represented in uppercase (e.g. LP31755-9).</p>

<!-- Use of LOINC Answer Lists -->
<a name="Use of LOINC Answer Lists"> </a>
<h4>Use of LOINC Answer Lists</h4>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://loinc.org/kb/users-guide/additional-content-in-the-loinc-distribution/">LOINC Manual</a> section 9.2, 
LOINC also defines Answer Lists for use in various forms and questionnaires. Both the list of Answers and the individual answers have String Ids. 
LOINC Answer String IDs are also valid LOINC codes:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;coding&gt;
    &lt;system value=&quot;http://loinc.org&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;code value=&quot;LA11165-0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;display value=&quot;Platelet anisocytosis&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/coding&gt;
</pre>
<p>LOINC Answer List Ids are associated with implicit value set identifiers. See <a href="#LOINC Answer Lists">below</a> for how to use these.</p>

<!-- RDF -->
<a name="RDF"> </a>
<h4>RDF</h4>
<p>LOINC uses the namespace http://loinc.org/rdf# as the root for LOINC concepts in the RDF space. This means that when a LOINC code is converted from the system:code pair, where the system is http://loinc.org, to the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html">RDF ontological form</a>, the representation is http://loinc.org/rdf#[code].</p>

<!-- LOINC Properties -->
<a name="LOINC Properties"> </a>
<h4>LOINC Properties</h4>
<p>The following code system properties are defined when using LOINC in FHIR. These properties are found in $lookup responses, and can also be 
used in filters.</p>

Notes about this table:

<ul>
 <li>The information about the source of the property in the LOINC distribution is provided to help implementers, but is just advisory, not prescriptive or normative, and subject to ongoing change as the LOINC distribuition is maintained.</li>
 <li>For legacy reasons, the property names in this table do not have consistent name, case etc, but they are correct and the correct name and case SHALL be used</li>
 <li>Note that when a <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-operation-lookup.html">$lookup</a> operation is performed on a LOINC code, servers SHALL return the version being used (see above) in the <code>version</code> property.

<tr><td>DisplayName</td> <td>string</td> <td>A name that is more 'clinician-friendly' compared to the current LOINC Short Name, Long Common Name, and Fully Specified Name.

Notes about this table:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>LOINC provides translations of these designations to many languages. Due to the way the LOINC translations work, part codes may have multiple Display Names which are considered synonyms.</li>

 <tr><td>Comments</td> <td>the "parent" filter selects immediate parents only. For example, the code "44022-2" has the parent "LP52960-9". 
  Ancestor includes parents transitively, e.g. "LP52960-9" eventually has a parent "LP31755-9", so the code "44022-2" is in the set of codes that have ancestor=LP31755-9.
  <br/>
  Note that because of the way LOINC is defined, the ancestors / descendents of a LOINC concept (derived from the PATH_TO_ROOT in the component hierarchy) 
  may not match exactly the list that could be calculated from the explicit parent/child properties.

<!-- LOINC Implicit Value Sets -->
<a name="LOINC Implicit Value Sets"> </a>
<h4>LOINC Implicit Value Sets</h4>
<p>Implicit value sets are those whose specification can be predicted based on the grammar of the underlying code system, and 
  the known structure of the URL that refers to them. LOINC defines several sets of implicit value sets:</p>
<ul>
 <li>By Component Hierarchy</li>
 <li>Answer Lists</li>
</ul>
<p>If any value set resources exist with an identifier that conforms to the URL patterns specified below, the 
content of the resource SHALL conform to the template provided. Profiles and other value set references are 
allowed to reference these value sets directly.</p>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The value set identifier http://loinc.org/vs is a value set that contains all LOINC codes.</li>
  <li>References to these value sets may be versioned: <code>http://loinc.org/vs/[partcode]|[version]</code>. The version SHALL match an official LOINC version, and if specified, both
  the ValueSet.version and ValueSet.compose.include.version SHALL match the specified version. In the absence of a specified version, a terminology server / service interpreting 
  the ValueSet reference SHALL use its latest available LOINC version.</li>
</ul>

<h5>LOINC and Data Elements</h5>
<p>LOINC codes and their properties are describing a data element that can have a value. Functionally, this overlaps with FHIR's notion of a <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/structuredefinition.html#logical">Logical Data Model</a>.  A logical data model can be created for each LOINC code based on it's properties.  The representation of each logical model is aligned with LOINC's RDF representation.</p>

<p>The canonical URL <code>http://loinc.org/rdf#[LOINC code]</code> can be used to refer to logical model elements defined by LOINC such as e.g. in <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-definitions.html#Questionnaire.item.definition">Questionnaire.item.definition</a>.</p>
<p>The appropriate type is determined by mapping from the LOINC specified SCALE_TYP for v3 to FHIR using this table:</p>
