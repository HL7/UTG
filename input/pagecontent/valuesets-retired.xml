  <p>
    The Value Sets listed here have been publisbed at some point in the past by HL7, but have been retired and are no longer
     being maintained.  They will not be validated nor expanded, as in many cases the underlying Code 
     System content has been changed and the Value Set CLD are no longer valid or correct.  They are 
     kept here for historical and archival purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Retirement has been declared by the HL7 steward of the ValueSet and indicates that the formal status of the resource is no longer active.
