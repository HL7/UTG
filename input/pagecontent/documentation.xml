	<h3>Introductory Information</h3>
	<p>
		The HL7 Terminology viewable here rendered as web pages represents a new way for HL7 to publish its terminology and vocabulary, which hitherto has been largely contained within various Standards and Guides in the different HL7 Product families.
		These web pages represent an attempt to gather all of the information that the HL7 community needs in order to implement systems and interfaces, based on the published HL7 Standards, in one place and eailly accessible.
		The information on these pages will be updated frequently as requested and agreed changes and enhancemments are made.

	<h3>Terminology Maintenance at HL7</h3>
	<p>
		HL7 maintains multiple terminologies. However, ongoing maintenance of these terminologies proved
		to be resource intensive and quite opaque to much of the community and thus a need for a uniform vocabulary governance process
		or strategy across all the HL7 terminologies was identified. As FHIR and associated implementation guides became more popular
		and as HL7 continued to grow, this was identified as an increasing issue. The new Unified Terminology Governance (UTG) process maintains the terminologies that
		support all of HL7’s focus areas (V2, V3, FHIR, CDA, etc.) in a way that is responsive and improves quality. As well, the process meets
		the community’s expectations for a more modern, continuous peer-feedback related process.

	<h4>UTG Education and Training</h4>
	<p>
		A set of educational training sessions have been created for the different groups of people using the HL7 Terminology. It is highly recommended
		that HL7 Terminology users view these sessions based on their use or involvement in the maintenance of the HL7 Terminology.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://youtu.be/vmZ71_cgYhI">The HL7 Terminology</a> - This session introduces the HL7 terminology publication website and shows how to view and access this published terminology content that is referenced in HL7 standards.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://youtu.be/iuc6PAsmVxY">Terminology Governance and Publishing at HL7</a> - This session covers the same topics from "The HL7 Terminology" session, as well the publishing process for new releases and the update process for the current content.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://youtu.be/uqOPa4M4sLU">Reviewing and Voting on HL7 Vocabulary Change Proposals</a> - This session walks HL7
		Terminology reviewers through the Unified Terminology Governance voting process for vocabulary maintenance at HL7. Reviewers
		will learn how examine a change proposal and cast a vote. The session will also cover the mechanics behind consensus review,
		including voter groups, vote weights, the consensus review workflow and possible outcomes for a change proposal.
	</p>
	<p>
		COMING SOON - A series of tutorials for those needing to submit a change proposal are currently being developed.

	<h3>Common (Unified) Characteristics</h3>
	<p>
		HL7 has adopted a common overall notional architecture for terminology across all of its product families.  This architecture is focussed on representing all terminology in Code Systems and Value Sets.
		Work has been done to adapt all related vocabulary and termminology designs across the HL7 product famillies to these common structures.   See the secitons below
		for discussions of how this has been done for the different product families.   The common form used by these new designs are based on FHIR CodeSystem and ValueSet resources, and includes
		a number of extensions and special properties to correctly capture, in a machine-processable way, all of the older information in the HL7 product family terminology
		structures.  This mapping has been done in order to facilitate maintenance and publishing (on these pages) of all of the HL7 Terminology, and to eanble the content to be unified where appropriate
		in the future.
	</p>
	<a name="ContentOvw"> </a>
	<h4>Content</h4>
	<p>
		The HL7 Terminology consists of Code Systems, Value Sets, Concept Maps, and Naming Systems.  Code Systems and Value Sets are core components of all of the
		HL7 product families.  In addition, Naming Systems and Concept Maps are defined within the FHIR specifications.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Code Systems</em> are managed collections of concepts.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Value Sets</em> are managed collections of concept drawn from one or more Code Systems.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Naming Systems</em> are collections of objects with known identifiers.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Concept Maps</em> are objects containing relationship information between concepts across code systems</li>
		<li>
			<em>V3 Concept Domains</em> have been represented in the new HL7 Terminology process and publication as a single Code System of concepts, with each Concept Domain represented as a concept with an extensive set of properties.   These are found in the set of Unified Code Systems.</li>
		<li>
			<em>V2 Tables</em> have been represented in the new HL7 Terinology process and publication as a single Code System of concepts, with each table being a concept with an extensive set of properties. These are found in the set of Unified Code Systems.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>External Terminology</h4>
	<p>
		There are hundreds of terminologies and code sets used to support Healthcare systems, persistence, and communication in use in the world, maintained and published by many organizations outside of HL7, and across
		many many nations.   Virtually all implementations based on HL7 Standards include one or more of these terminologies in the implementation guidance and conformance rules, both those publshed outside of HL7,
		and those defined, maintained, and published by HL7.
		For the convenience of implementers and users, certain of these have been explicitly identified over the years by the HIT community, and the technical components for their unambiguous identification
		and use have been published in the HL7 Standards and Guides.  In addtion, a few of these have had their content encapsulated in the designs of HL7 terminology structues to facilitate their use by the HL7 communinity.
		These have been imported to this new publishing form for the convenience of the community, and the terms of compliancit is hoped that it be used in a common way across all of the
		HL7 product families that need to reference or use these external terminologies.
