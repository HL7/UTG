# 03 These value sets are supposed to exist
Review the All Codes Value Set - incomplete CodeSystems generally should not have an all codes value set specified

# 04 Not HTML tags.
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<p'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour

# 05 Can't be helped
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed

WARNING: 1: The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
WARNING: 4: The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablecodesystem|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
An HTML fragment from the set [dependency-table.xhtml, dependency-table-short.xhtml, dependency-table-nontech.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# 09 expected behaviour
The value set references CodeSystem 'http://www.ada.org/snodent' which has status 'fragment'

# 10 need to figure out what's up with the slicing stuff at a later date

The System URI could not be determined for the code 'att' in the ValueSet 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/hl7-work-group|5.2.0'

# 15 True, but these are retired code systems so we'll ignore it
When a CodeSystem has content = 'complete', it doesnt make sense for there to be no concepts defined

# 16 guide-parameter-code needs to be used but is experimental in the core spec

It is not valid to refer to a CodeSystem by an identifier like this 'urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238' - use 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0005'
