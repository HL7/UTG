# 03 These value sets are supposed to exist
Review the All Codes Value Set - incomplete CodeSystems generally should not have an all codes value set specified

# 04 Not HTML tags.
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<p'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'A '. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'IC'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour

# 07 warnings that apply to normal IGs but not to THO
WARNING: 1: The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
WARNING: 4: The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablecodesystem|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
An HTML fragment from the set [dependency-table.xhtml, dependency-table-short.xhtml, dependency-table-nontech.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
The IG is not for the international realm, and it uses SNOMED CT, so it should fix the SCT edition in the expansion parameters

# 08 expected behaviour
The value set references CodeSystem 'http://www.ada.org/snodent' which has status 'fragment'
The value set references CodeSystem 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-mediaType' which has status 'fragment'
Unable to evaluate based on code system with status = not-present
The value set references CodeSystem 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/insurance-plan-type' which has status 'fragment'

# 09 need to figure out what's up with the slicing stuff at a later date
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablevalueset|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# 10 this is THO
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
