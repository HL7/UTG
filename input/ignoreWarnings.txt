# to be investigated
The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this extension

# These value sets are supposed to exist
Review the All Codes Value Set - incomplete CodeSystems generally should not have an all codes value set specified

# Not HTML tags.
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<p'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'A '. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'IC'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour

# Can't be helped
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed
The value set include has too many codes to validate (0), so each individual code has not been checked

# this is THO
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# known issue with jurisdiction
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# Will deal with properties in a future release
This property has only a code ('Specializes') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem
This property has only a code ('Generalizes') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem
The code 'EVN.CRT' is valid but is deprecated
This property has only a code ('abstract') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem
