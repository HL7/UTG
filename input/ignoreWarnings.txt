# warnings that apply to normal IGs but not to THO
WARNING: 1: The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
WARNING: 2: An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
WARNING: 3: An HTML fragment from the set [dependency-table.xhtml, dependency-table-short.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
WARNING: 4: The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablecodesystem|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# expected behaviour
The value set references CodeSystem 'http://www.ada.org/snodent' which has status 'fragment'

# This is already active
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/provenance-participant-type|1.1.0

# expected issues with large value sets
INFORMATION: ValueSet/snomed-intl-gps: ValueSet.compose.include[0]: The value set include has too many codes to validate (26,157)

# this is THO
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
