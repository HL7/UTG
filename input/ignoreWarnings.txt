# 03 These value sets are supposed to exist
Review the All Codes Value Set - incomplete CodeSystems generally should not have an all codes value set specified

# 04 Not HTML tags.
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<p'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'A '. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'IC'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour

# 07 warnings that apply to normal IGs but not to THO
WARNING: 1: The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
WARNING: 4: The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablecodesystem|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
An HTML fragment from the set [dependency-table.xhtml, dependency-table-short.xhtml, dependency-table-nontech.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
The IG is not for the international realm, and it uses SNOMED CT, so it should fix the SCT edition in the expansion parameters

# 08 expected behaviour
The value set references CodeSystem 'http://www.ada.org/snodent' which has status 'fragment'
The value set references CodeSystem 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-mediaType' which has status 'fragment'
Unable to evaluate based on code system with status = not-present
The value set references CodeSystem 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/insurance-plan-type' which has status 'fragment'

# 09 need to figure out what's up with the slicing stuff at a later date
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablevalueset|5.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# 10 this is THO
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 11 known issue with jurisdiction
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0
VALUESET_UNKNOWN_FILTER_PROPERTY_NO_CS

# 12 Will deal with properties in a future release
This property has only a code ('Specializes') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem
This property has only a code ('Generalizes') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem
The code 'EVN.CRT' is valid but is deprecated
This property has only a code ('abstract') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem

# 14 This code should have remained in the code system for backwards compatibility.  These value sets should have new stewards though.
Terminology_TX_NoValid_16

# 15 True, but these are retired code systems so we'll ignore it
When a CodeSystem has content = 'complete', it doesnt make sense for there to be no concepts defined

# 16 Undefined properties will be dealt with later
The property 'Name:role:scoper:Entity' has no definition in CodeSystem.property. Many terminology tools won't know what to do with it
The property 'v2cs-uri' has no definition in CodeSystem.property. Many terminology tools won't know what to do with it
The property 'status' has no definition in CodeSystem.property. Many terminology tools won't know what to do with it
Unknown CodeSystem Property 'http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#deprecated'. If you are creating your own property, do not create it in the HL7 namespace
The property 'inactive' has no definition in CodeSystem.property. Many terminology tools won't know what to do with it
	
# 17 Edge case where this makes sense
