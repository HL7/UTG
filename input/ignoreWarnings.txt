# Don't error on case-sensitive for now
CodeSystems SHOULD have a stated value for the caseSensitive element so that users know the status and meaning of the code system clearly

# needs to be fixed infrastructurally
The Coding provided is not in the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/designation-use, and a code should come from this value set unless it has no suitable code.  (error message = Not in value set http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/designation-use)
