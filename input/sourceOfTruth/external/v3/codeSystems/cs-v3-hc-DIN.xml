  <description value="**Description:** A Drug Identification Number (DIN) is a computer-generated eight digit number assigned by Health Canada to a drug product prior to being marketed in Canada. It uniquely identifies all drug products sold in a dosage form in Canada and is located on the label of prescription and over-the-counter drug products that have been evaluated and authorized for sale in Canada.
    
    A DIN uniquely identifies the following product characteristics:
    
    manufacturer;
    product name;
    active ingredient(s);
    strength(s) of active ingredient(s);
    pharmaceutical form; and
    route of administration.
