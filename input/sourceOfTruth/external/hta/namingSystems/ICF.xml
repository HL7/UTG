  <description value="&quot;The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, known more commonly as ICF, is a classification of health and health-related domains.
As the functioning and disability of an individual occurs in a context, ICF also includes a list of environmental factors.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ICF is the WHO framework for measuring health and disability at both individual and population levels.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ICF was officially endorsed by all 191 WHO Member States in the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly on 22 May 2001(resolution [WHA 54.21](http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA54/ea54r21.pdf) ) as the international standard to describe and measure health and disability.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ICF is based on the same foundation as ICD and ICHI and share the same set of extension codes that enable documentation at a higher level of detail.&quot;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Official updates to the ICF are available as annual lists of changes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;These updates are approved annually at the October meeting of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) Network.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To license ICF, the same rules apply for ICF as for ICD.
