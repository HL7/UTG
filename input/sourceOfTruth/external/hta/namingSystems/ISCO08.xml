  <description value="&quot;The International Classification of Occupations (ISCO) seeks to facilitate international communication about occupations by providing statisticians with a framework to make internationally comparable occupational data available, and by allowing international occupational data to be produced in a form that can be useful for research as well as for specific decision-making and action-oriented activities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The current version, known as ISCO-08, was published in 2008 and is the fourth iteration, following ISCO-58, ISCO-68 and ISCO-88.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since the year 1968, the practice is to revise ISCO every 20 years. ISCO revision can only be undertaken if it is mandated by the ICLS. ISCO-08 revision is currently undertaken by the ILO with the assistance of a Technical Working Group (TWG).&quot;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Additional details about ISCO-08 can be found [here](https://ilostat.ilo.org/methods/concepts-and-definitions/classification-occupation/)"/>
