  <description value="The ISRCTN registry is a primary clinical study registry recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) that accepts all clinical research studies (whether proposed, ongoing or completed), providing content validation and curation and the unique identification number necessary for publication. All study records in the database are freely accessible and searchable.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;ISRCTN supports transparency in clinical research, helps reduce selective reporting of results and ensures an unbiased and complete evidence base.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The registry aims to include all interventional and non-interventional clinical studies that prospectively involve UK participants and evaluate biomedical or health-related outcomes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Studies conducted outside the UK or considered to be non-clinical studies (e.g. public health studies) can be registered on ISRCTN.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Studies should ideally be registered prospectively (before recruitment starts). ISRCTN also accepts studies registered retrospectively once they are underway or after completion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;See [https://www.isrctn.com/](https://www.isrctn.com/)."/>
