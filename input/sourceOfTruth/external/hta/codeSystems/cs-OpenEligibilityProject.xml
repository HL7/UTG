  <description value="&quot;The Open Eligibility Project is a collaborative for a series of standards for the human services sector. The Open Eligibility taxonomy is a simple way to categorize human services and human situations. With these common categories, we, as service providers, navigators, and people in need, can find human services quickly and easily.&quot;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&quot;The Open Eligibility taxonomy consists of two important concepts: Human Services and Human Situations.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Human Services are services offered by government or charitable organizations, and include things such as housing, food pantries or counseling services.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Human Situations are ways of describing attributes of a person that could help them find programs they are looking for, including examples like: veterans, physical disability or seniors.&quot;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;For more information, see [https://support.findhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404055283227-The-Open-Eligibility-Project](https://support.findhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404055283227-The-Open-Eligibility-Project)"/>
