  <description value="The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. The scope includes the test's purpose, methodology, validity, evidence of the test&#39;s usefulness, and laboratory contacts and credentials. The overarching goal of the GTR is to advance the public health and research into the genetic basis of health and disease.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Each Test is a specific, orderable test from a particular laboratory, and is assigned a unique GTR accession number. The format is GTR00000001.1, with a leading prefix &quot;GTR&quot; followed by 8 digits, a period, then 1 or more digits representing the version. When a laboratory updates a registered test, a new version number is assigned.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To find all laboratories in GTR and all registered tests, see here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/all/tests/?term=all%5Bsb%5D"/>
