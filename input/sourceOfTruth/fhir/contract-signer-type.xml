The dependent has an association with the subscriber such as a financial dependency or personal relationship such as that of a spouse, or a natural or adopted child. The policy holder may be required by law to recognize certain associations or may have discretion about the associations. For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents. Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently-abled or deceased, a guardian ad lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriber&#39;s legal standing in the relationship with the dependent.</td>

    <definition value="A person covered under an insurance policy or program based on an association with a subscriber, which is recognized by the policy holder. The dependent has an association with the subscriber such as a financial dependency or personal relationship such as that of a spouse, or a natural or adopted child.

For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents. Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently-abled or deceased, a guardian ad lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriber&#39;s legal standing in the relationship with the dependent."/>
