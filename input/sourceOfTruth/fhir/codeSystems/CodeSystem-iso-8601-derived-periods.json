    "description": "Defines codes for the representation of age ranges that are unambiguous, human readable and machine-readable as a compositional grammar (i.e. the code system defines rules for constructing codes, rather than explicitly enumerating the possible codes). Age ranges are expressed through two simple durations as defined in the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) specification.\n\nCodes in the code system are defined according to the grammar:\n\nAn age range is defined as two durations: `<duration1>--<duration2>`, where `duration1` specifies the lower inclusive bound of the age range (everyone who is this age and above) and `duration2` specifies the upper exclusive bound of the age range.\n\nFor example, the age range \"1-9 years\" means everyone who is at least one year old and less than 10 years old represented as `P1Y--P10Y`. The age range \"10-14 years\" means everyone who is at least 10 years old and less than 15 years old and is represented as `P10Y--P15Y`.\n\nDurations define the amount of time between two time points. These durations are represented in the form `P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S` or `P[n]W`. The `[n]` is replaced by the value for each of the time elements that follow the `[n]` and the letters have the meaning:\n\n* `P` is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the duration representation.\n* `Y` is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.\n* `M` is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.\n* `W` is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.\n* `D` is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.\n* `T` is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.\n* `H` is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.\n* `M` is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.\n* `S` is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds. (Note that seconds can be a decimal in this format to allow for milliseconds)\n\nContent for this code system is adapted from the definition in the IHE-ADX profile: https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_ADX.pdf (Appendix 8K Representation of Age Groups in ADX). In addition, the code system definition is adapted from similar content published as part of the SANER implementation guide.
