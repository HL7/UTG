Self-insured sponsors delegate coverage administration, but not risk, to third-party administrators. Program sponsors designate services to be covered in accordance with statute. Program sponsors may administer the coverage themselves, delegate coverage administration, but not risk to third-party administrators, or contract with health insurance plans to assume the risk and administrator a program. Sponsors qualify individuals who may become&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  a policy holder of the plan;&#xD;&#xA;2.  where the sponsor is the policy holder, who may become a subscriber or a dependent to a policy under the plan; or&#xD;&#xA;3.  where the sponsor is a government agency, who may become program eligibles under a program.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The sponsor role may be further qualified by the SponsorRole.code.
