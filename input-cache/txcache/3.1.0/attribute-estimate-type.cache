I2 can be readily calculated from basic results obtained from a typical meta-analysis as i2 = 100%×(q - df)/q, where q is cochran's heterogeneity statistic and df the degrees of freedom. Negative values of i2 are put equal to zero so that i2 lies between 0% and 100%. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing heterogeneity. Unlike cochran's q, it does not inherently depend upon the number of studies considered. A confidence interval for i² is constructed using either i) the iterative non-central chi-squared distribution method of hedges and piggott (2001); or ii) the test-based method of higgins and thompson (2002). The non-central chi-square method is currently the method of choice (higgins, personal communication, 2006) – it is computed if the 'exact' option is selected."
