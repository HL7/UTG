  <description value="Concepts describing a person&#x2019;s employment as defined by compensation and sector (e.g. paid vs. unpaid, self-employed vs. not self-employed, government vs. private, etc.). Generally, employment status refers to whether or not a person is currently employed for wages or doing some other unpaid activity, such as volunteering, homemaking, or participating in educational instruction as a student. In a healthcare setting, employment status may be used to determine appropriate probing questions for occupational exposures and occupational history. For example, a person who is currently not employed for wages may be prompted to provide information about previously held occupations."/>
