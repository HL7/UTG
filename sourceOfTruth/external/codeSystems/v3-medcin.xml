      <p>MEDCIN contains more than 175,000 clinical data elements arranged in a hierarchy, with each item having weighted links to relevant diagnoses.  The clinical data elements are organized into six basic termtypes designed to accommodate information relevant to a clinical encounter.  The basic termtypes in MEDCIN&#39;s terminological hierarchy are as follows:</p>
                  
      <p>Symptoms History Physical Examination Tests Diagnoses Therapy</p>
                  
      <p>Within this basic structure, MEDCIN terms are further organized in a ten level terminological hierarchy, supplemented by an optional, multi-hierarchical diagnostic index.  For example, the symptom of &quot;difficulty breathing&quot; is placed in the terminological hierarchy as a subsidiary (or &quot;child&quot;) finding of &quot;pulmonary symptoms,&quot; although the presence (or absence) of difficulty breathing can related to conditions as diverse as myocardial infarction, bronchitis, pharyngeal foreign bodies, asthma, pulmonary embolism, etc.  MEDCIN&#39;s diagnostic index provides more than 800 such links for difficulty breathing.</p>
