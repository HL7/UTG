  <description value="The Standard Industrial Classification Codes that appear in a company&#39;s disseminated EDGAR filings indicate the company&#39;s type of business. These codes are also used in the Division of Corporation Finance as a basis for assigning review responsibility for the company&#39;s filings. For example, a company whose business was Metal Mining (SIC 1000) would have its filings reviewed by staffers in A/D Office 4. Note that this code system is published both by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/siccodes.htm, and by the US Occupational &amp; Safety Health Administration (OSHA) at http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic\_manual.html."/>
