      <p>This part of ISO 639 provides a code consisting of language code elements comprising two-letter 

language identifiers for the representation of names of languages. The language identifiers 

according to this part of ISO 639 were devised originally for use in terminology, lexicography and 

linguistics, but may be adopted for any application requiring the expression of language in two-

letter coded form, especially in computerized systems. The alpha-2 code was devised for practical 

use for most of the major languages of the world that are not only most frequently represented in 

the total body of the world&#39;s literature, but which also comprise a considerable volume of 

specialized languages and terminologies. Additional language identifiers are created when it 

becomes apparent that a significant body of documentation written in specialized languages and 

terminologies exists. Languages designed exclusively for machine use, such as computer-programming 

languages, are not included in this code.</p>
