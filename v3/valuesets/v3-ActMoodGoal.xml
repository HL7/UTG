        <b>Definition:</b>An observation that is considered to be desirable to occur in the future. The essential feature of a goal is that if it occurs it would be considered as a marker of a positive outcome or of progress towards a positive outcome.

        <b>Examples:</b>Target weight below 80Kg, Stop smoking, Regain ability to walk, goal is to administer thrombolytics to candidate patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.

        <b>Discussion:</b> INT (intent) reflects a plan for the future, which is a declaration to do something.  This contrasts with goal which doesn&#39;t represent an intention to act, merely a hope for an eventual result.  A goal is distinct from the intended actions to reach that goal.  &quot;I will reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg&quot; is an intent.  &quot;I hope to be able to get the patient to the point where I can reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg&quot; is a goal. EXPEC (expectation) reflects a prediction rather than a hope. RSK (risk) reflects a potential negative event rather than a hope.
