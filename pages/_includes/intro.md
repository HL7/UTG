## Introduction
This is the home page for the full set of all terminology defined and published by HL7, as part of the new UTG process.

The Unified Terminology Governance (UTG) project is centralizing HL7 vocabulary artifacts (Code Systems, Value Sets, Concept Maps, etc.) across all product families (v2, v3/CDA, FHIR).  Among the outcomes of UTG are: (1) improvements to internal maintenance and harmonization processes, (2) a single entry point for the user community to access content for browsing and downloading, and (3) guidance for implementers of HL7-curated terminologies.  Platform independent tooling has been developed to support consensus-based authoring and reviewing of proposed changes to content among worldwide stakeholders.  See further UTG project details [**here**](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VOC/Unified+Terminology+Governance+Project+%28UTG%29+Page).

Users may browse the HL7 terminology on these pages.
