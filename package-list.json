  "introduction" : "This is the main entry page for access to the HL7 Terminology. This material comprises the Code Systems and Value Sets which are cited in HL7 Published artifacts (International Standards and Implemenation Guides).  These pages also contain Concept Maps and Naming Systems defined and published by HL7, accessible here for the convenience of the implementation community.   There is also an option to download the terminology along with some additional components.\r\n  \r\n   As part of the HL7 approach to provide unified governance and support consistent access to the terminology and vocabulary that has been published for many years, all of the published Code Systems and Value Sets across all of the main HL7 Product families is intended to be accessible on these pages.   This includes Version 2, Version 3, CDA (base only), and FHIR.   Note that the full unification of all of the terminology content of HL7 Code Systems will be an ongoing effort.  \r\n   \r\n   The new HL7 process for governance and maintenance of the vocabulary published by HL7 is called 'UTG'; for more information see the documentation on the [UTG Project Page](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VOC/Unified+Terminology+Governance+Project+%28UTG%29+Page). This process employs a community-wide, consensus-based, continuous process for updates to the terminology. Periodically, a snapshot of the terminology (which is verified to be internally consistent) will be taken as a new 'release' of the HL7 Terminology.   All such published releases will be accessible from these pages (see the table below).  \r\n   \r\n   ### Published Releases of HL7 Terminology\r\n   The table below provides a list of the releases of the HL7 Terminology that are available.  The link to '(current)' leads to the frequently updated continuous integration builds page where the most recent approved changes that are not yet in a release may be found.  \r\n   \r\n   #### A Word about Versions\r\n   The HL7 Terminology releases carry a 3-part release version identifier, in the format of Major.Minor.Patch.  \r\n   The Major number indicates a new major release, and will be updated when significant new content is added, or there are substantial layout and formatting changes, or changes are being released which MAY break some backward comatibility.  The Minor number will be reset to zero whenever there is a new major release.  \r\n   The Minor number will be incremented on every release.  These will consist of one to many approved changes to the HL7 vocabulary.   Occasinally it may coincide with other HL7 Standards releases for synchronization purposes. The Patch number will be reset to zero on a new minor release.  \r\n   The Patch number for relases will usually remain at zero, unless a small errata or technical correction is absolutely required.  This number will be incremented on the HL7 Terminology ci build page with every new commit of changes and rebuild, and thus is important primarily on the continuous build page at (current).\r\n   \r\n   ",
